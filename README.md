### Development Environment
Android Studio 3.2.1
****  
### Project description
Our project is going to be centered around Spotify. We are going to use Spotify APIâ€™s to access user data and listening history. We will use this information to construct databases to keep track of musical tastes.

### Functionality

#### Basic functions:

Search music database by tracks, artists, albums

Know top popular tracks, artists, albums

Follow/unfollow other users  


#### Advanced functions:

Calculate similarity statistics between different songs, artists, genres and albums. This will be interesting because it will allow us to see what the most common musical tastes are. It will also tell us whether a fan of one artist is likely to be a fan of another artist.



Recommend playlists to groups of people based on their listening habits. This is also an interesting feature because it will be good in social situations. Oftentimes it is hard to get many people in a room to agree on what to listen to. This function could help to solve this problem.
