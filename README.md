### Development Environment
Android Studio 3.2.1
****  
### Project description
Our project is going to be centered around Spotify. We are going to use Spotify API’s to access user data and listening history. We will use this information to construct databases to keep track of musical tastes.
****
### Functionality

#### Basic functions:

Add Spotify user

Remove Spotify user

Search music database by artist, album, or song title

Get user’s saved albums and playlists

#### Advanced functions:

Calculate similarity statistics between different songs, artists, genres and albums. This will be interesting because it will allow us to see what the most common musical tastes are. It will also tell us whether a fan of one artist is likely to be a fan of another artist, for example.



Recommend playlists to groups of people based on their listening habits. This is also an interesting feature because it will be good in social situations. Oftentimes it is hard to get many people in a room to agree on what to listen to. This function could help to solve this problem.
